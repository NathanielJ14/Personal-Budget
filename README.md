# Personal Budget Tracker

I made this project a way to showcase my skills and learn new skills through implementation. The application provides a way for a user to create different budgets for whatever they want and then track (add/delete) their income and expenses.
Next.js is used as the front end, C# is used as the back end, and SQL server is used as the database.
